The idea of the problem here is quite simple. You have two **coherent** and
**monochromatic** light sources, a screen, and the aim is to figure out the
light pattern on the screen. Due to interference, the intensity should not
be uniform on the screen.

The math here is actually quite simple. If you fix the wavelength as a
parameter, you know the wave function of the two sources at the sources.
Thanks to propagation, you also know that these wave functions, at any point
in space, only depend on the distance to the source point.

The only thing remaining to do is to add those wave functions and figure out
what the intensity is depending on the position of the point.

A short [explanation video][yti] is online.
