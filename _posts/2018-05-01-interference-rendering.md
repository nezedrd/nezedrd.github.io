Project on [github][ghi].

I used pyplot to implement a graphical visualisation of this phenomenon. The
idea of this rendering is to give an idea of the behaviour of light intensity,
close to the source points and on a distant screen.

Some parameters can be changed to show how they influence the result. Reducing
the distance between the source points, for instance, shows on the screen that
the light pattern is not a sine.

Finally if you add a phase delay between the two sources, you add dissimetry
to the result.
