Project on [github][ghi].

I used this project to discover a lot of features in python, matplotlib, etc.
A good take away for this experiment is the [demo video][ytv] demonstrating
the evolution of the interference figure depending on the parameters.

We can see for example that changing the wavelength doesn't move the central
fringe because of how we coded the phase difference.
